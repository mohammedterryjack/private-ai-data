"""
Centralized prompts for File Ingestor service.

This module contains all the prompts used throughout the File Ingestor service
to ensure consistency and easy maintenance.

Currently, this service doesn't use any LLM prompts directly,
but this file is maintained for future use and consistency.
"""

# Future prompts can be added here as needed
# Example:
# FILE_PROCESSING_PROMPT = "Process the following file content..."
# METADATA_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = "Extract metadata from the following document..."
